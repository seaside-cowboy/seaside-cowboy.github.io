    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>My name is G.A. Alexander. I'm 24. I'm from Monticello, Misssissippi, a small town of about ~1300 people. In 2023, I moved to Ontario with what I could fit in my car to further my education and chase my passions. My dream is to create memorable experiences and content and never stop! As a young creative professional, I'm open to the many ways that dream can take shape. 
      I'm eligible to work in both the U.S. and Canada. Disclaimer: This should go without saying but my thoughts and actions are not representative of anyone but myself. </p>

  <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>I was born with eleven fingers. No, I no longer have eleven fingers.</li>
  <li>I used to compete in Rainbow Six Siege at the collegiate level.</li>
  <li>My partner is a Newfoundlander. Mississippi + Newfoundland = Our Children are Doomed to Never Speak Normal English.</li>
  <li>My favorite game of all time is Super Mario Galaxy.</li>
  <li>I can play a variety of instruments; I was a band kid.</li>
  <li>Outside of video games, I'm also really into sports, true crime, music, and film.</li>
  <li>I have a hard time being a "traditional" professional esports/sports fan as I struggle choosing a favorite team and often feel more connected to players than teams. 
    (Disclaimer: This does not apply to the college level). </li>
</ul>
