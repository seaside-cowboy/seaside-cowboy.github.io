    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>My name is G.A. Alexander. I'm 24. I'm from Monticello, Misssissippi, a small town of about ~1300 people. In 2023, I moved to Ontario. I make things under the moniker Seaside Cowboy
    or Seaside Cowboy Productions. Some would maybe say I'm a Lakeside Cowboy now though. :P I'm eligible to work in both the U.S. and Canada.
      
      This should go without saying but my thoughts and actions are not representative of anyone but myself! </p>
